# stage criteria

These are the criteria I would like to meet to feel as thought I have ached a successful project.

stage | name                        | description
----- | --------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------
1     | smart shades                | make a set of smart sun classes
2     | auto smart shades           | add ldr to control the opacity
3     | auto smart point shades     | add camera to make dark point over dark points
4     | controllable smart shades   | add options to swap between modes
5     | driving/safety improvements | auto react headlights ect

## plan

The plan is to use two lcd's with the backlight removed to create dimmable panels in front of the users eyes. Then eventually add a camera to make point control to block bright spots like projectors and the sun and dim them to reduce squinting.

# hopefull final mockup ![final mockup design image](final_design_plan.svg)

So once I have removed the backlight from the LCD's I can mount them in a frame I can then begin to control the contrast/pixel density to make them dim. I will then add a LDR to automate the brightness selection this will remove the manual adjust but I will Leave the buttons to set the levels. next I will add a camera to the system so that it can also detect bright points and make a matching point darker on the lens. I will then use the buttons to make it so you can swap between the modes. The final feature addition I would like to add is some intelligence on the camera side to ignore certain circumstances like car tail/headlights
