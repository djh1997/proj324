# stage criteria

these are the criteria I would like to meet to feel as thought I have ached a successful project

stage | name                        | description
----- | --------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------
1     | smart shades                | make a set of smart sun classes
2     | auto smart shades           | add ldr to control the opacity
3     | auto smart point shades     | add camera to make dark point over dark points
4     | controllable smart shades   | add options to swap between modes
5     | driving/safety improvements | auto react headlights ect

## plan

The plan is to use two lcd's with the backlight removed to create dimmable panels in front of the users eyes. Then eventually add a camera to make point control to block bright spots like projectors and the sun and dim them to reduce squinting.
