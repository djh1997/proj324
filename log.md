-   find c++ library from adafruit [ST7735-c+++](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit-ST7735-Library)
-   find python library [ST7735-micro](https://github.com/hosaka/micropython-st7735), [ST7735-af c++ forked to py](https://github.com/cskau/Python_ST7735)

looking thought the code the ST7735-micro seems cleaner and looks like I will be able to modify it easier since it is broken into more small functions although the other python has image support so I will try both and asses
