# **Final Year Project**

# Stage Criteria

This is the criteria I would like to meet, to feel as though I have created a successful project.

Stage | Name                        | Description
----- | --------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------
1     | Smart shades                | Make a set of smart sun classes
2     | Auto smart shades           | Add LDR to control the opacity
3     | Auto smart point shades     | Add camera to make dark point over bright points
4     | Controllable smart shades   | Add options to swap between modes
5     | Driving/safety improvements | Auto react headlights etc.

## Plan

The product's above, along with Paul's lectures last year inspired my idea.

The plan is to use two LCD's with the backlight removed, to create dimmable panels in front of the users eyes. Then eventually I will add a camera to make point control which will block bright spots such as projectors and the sun, and dim them to reduce squinting.

So, once I have removed the backlight from the LCD's I can mount them in a frame. I can then begin to control the contrast/pixel density to make them dim. I will then add a LDR to automate the brightness selection, this will remove the manual adjust however I will leave the buttons to set the levels. Next I will add a camera to the system so that the system can also detect bright points hence make a matching point darker on the lens. I will then use the buttons to make it so that you can swap between the modes. The final additional feature I would like to add is some intelligence on the camera side to ignore certain circumstances such as car tail/headlights

# Report

I got the LCD hooked up and displayed some random spots of different opacity on the screen

I then conneted the camera and started blob detection and got that working ![final mock-up design image](log/IMG_1190.JPG)

I decided to use telegram to add remote control so that you could adjust the colour of the tint [remote control](https://t.me/smartsheadsfypbot)
